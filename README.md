OBSMAN
Currently a single developer toy-project for archiving astronomical observation files (".fits"). Highly depends on Astropy, aims to provide a solution for a superclass of formats used in Turkey.

TODO-HR:
- contact 4 observatories within Turkey (ask for sample ".fits" files)

TODO-IT:
- get rid of demonstration UI i.e. Node-RED
- use base debian or centos for docker images
- get rid of python 3.7 compile code, as 3.8 is the stable (f-string dependency resolved)
- use multi-thread safe database instead of sqlite, which was sufficient for single-session Node-RED UI

TODO-Repo:
- provide a branching policy ".txt" file
